The only way to describe it is by saying it feels like my lower insides are hard and stiff and when I am trying to stand up I am bending them a way that they should not.  I may not be explaining it correctly.  I am not sure if is just a bad period or if I should be worried,healthcare,2

"Fully Executed Lease with ""typo""
We have a fully executed lease which states the landlords responsibilities. This is essentially a chart which ""checks"" what the landlord pays vs. what the tenant pays.


Water, sewer and electricity are all ""checked"" as ""landlord pays"". We have operated under this assumption, and have even begun getting ""electricity"" charges on our rent, as we expected.


That being said - we came home yesterday and found the lights off. We called our service provider and they essentially said that the leasing company has the apartment in their name, but they haven't paid it, and to get it in our name to get the service back on we would need to wait 72+ hours while they investigate. We went back to our leasing company going WTF and they're saying ""they made a typo"" and this is our problem to deal with. 


We were given no indication at any point that we would need to set up electric service in our name, and especially given that they have had multiple contacts with us in recent months over unrelated issues, we have never been told it was our responsibility to do something beyond pay them through our rent.


We are now getting a lot of flack from them, saying that they are not responsible for it, won't help and don't care. Our electricity service provider is requiring the leasing company to pay the charges which are in arrears to get our service back on (at such time we can put it in our name).


I'm looking to see what kind of ground they have to stand on to behave this way, as they have signed a legally binding, fully executed lease which we had no indication was not correct in its entirety.

"Would Joel Tenenbaum or Jammie Thomas-Rasset be sued today?
What I understand is


1. Technically, Joel and Jammie were sued for *uploading*.
2. Practically, Joel and Jammie were sued for *downloading* and were unfortunate victims of not turning off seeding after downloading music via torrent: Their 'uploading' was not that they were really the original uploaders of the music like there was this torrent file and then it was uploaded from an account belonging to them. Rather, they were just seeding which is automatic in torrent clients (unless you set upload speed to zero or something...so I've heard).
3. Nowadays, it's much easier to both illegally download music and not have problems re the turn off seeding: **Just [download from youtube](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1648/is-downloading-youtube-videos-legal).**
4. Their trials were mid-2000s which is when YouTube just began. Over a decade later, not only is YouTube huge but also are there so many ways to download from YouTube.
5. Copyright law has not changed (in their favour) at all since then yet I think because of the advent of technology, **they are almost definitely not likely to be caught for illegally downloading** - at least music...movies are another matter - because they'd be just downloading!


	* 5.1. Btw, the relevant difference I see between music and other stuff like [movies/books/games](https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/6329/piracy-file-sharing-why-arent-songs-movies-or-ebooks-given-for-free-ads-l) is that full songs are legally uploaded on YouTube for us to listen to for free. It's the same idea as [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Taping_Is_Killing_Music). It's not like movies which may be fully legally uploaded but we still have to pay or books which afaik aren't uploaded fully at all.


**Question**: Did I misunderstand anything?


**Edit 1:**


I'm asking not if they'd be **sued if they were caught or whatever** but rather if maybe in the 1st place they **wouldn't even be caught**.


The conjecture I'm driving at here is that effectively (when I say 'effectively' here I mean in a de facto as opposed to a de jure sense) their crime **isn't exactly copyright infringement** but not having **good enough technology to commit copyright infringement**. The key difference here is YouTube downloading. YouTube wasn't as big then as it is now. And apparently it's a huge grey/gray area or whatever re downloading. YouTube is effectively radio without schedules. So you can think of downloading from YouTube as similar to home taping or whatever.


But yeah ok it's wrong if the RIAA have continued to catch people regardless of the advancement of technology (how would they know if their catch rates are as effective btw?) but simply stopped SLAPP or whatever.


**Edit 2:**


Another thing I thought of based on comment of Brandin: [De minimis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_minimis).



> 
> One user downloading something from YouTube, even if it's an infringement, is extremely small in terms of damage. (...) On the other hand, if you place something on a website or on a torrent, and let hundreds of people download that copy, the damages are much more significant

"Does protocol 1 article 1 (peaceful enjoyment) cover charging of rent for another to occupy property?
Does the right to peacefully enjoy one’s (residential/real) property [and possessions…] in the ECHR guarantee/protect the right to let it out to others for them to inhabit in exchange for rent?


In other words, as this appears in the ECHR it is made somehow transcendental and more fundamental than other laws. And it seems to exalt the ability to “enjoy“ or benefit from one’s belongings. What I am wondering is, whether this exaltation extends to real, residential property, like a flat or house, and even more to the point, if it extends to a larger portfolio of multiple such pieces of real, residential property, and does it extend to the right to derive benefit from the temporary exchange value (ie, does the protected right to “enjoy” it include the right to exchange or sell the right of enjoying it for a temporary period to others), or does it only include directly enjoying the use value of this type of property?


Of course, the answer may be that it covers the right live without undue encumbrances in ones own home, to a very high and fundamental degree, as well as the right to let out further properties to tenants but to a less absolute degree. For example, it may be that the ECHR doesn’t protect the right to be a residential landlord absolutely and unconditionally, so maybe restrictions on the ability to become a mogul slumlord like Peter Rachman is congruent with ECHR art. 1, but excessive restrictions on the ability to let out one or two additional residential properties to the one you inhabit are not.",law,0

"Take action against a hotel for negligence in accommodating a disabled guest?
My wife has diagnosed C-PTSD which her doctors have classified as a disability. She also lives with another disability related to a spinal injury which makes it difficult for her to walk. We are staying at a resort hotel in which we discovered sound readily transfers through the floors. This is evident due to frequent stomping above our room last night, and today when the cleaning crew presumably started work.


She got up around 3:00AM this morning to work on packing and cleaning our room. Around that time I also called reception to send us towels. A few minutes later the phone in our room rang, and I answered because I assumed it was reception calling us. The caller was actually another guest who I assume was in the room below us. He sounded intoxicated and was berating me for making sounds ""like an elephant."" I politely stated that if I had done anything to disturb him, I apologize. He hung up the phone. I was shocked he was able to call our room directly and this scenario was extremely triggering for my wife's PTSD symptoms. This was an extremely disturbing incident which the hotel failed to provide the level of security and safety that could reasonably be expected at a five star hotel.


We had actually been moved to this current room due to an incident that occurred the previous day. Since my wife is a survivor of a violent sexual assault, and especially because the assailant is still at large awaiting a criminal and civil resolution, when we arrived she was very specific and clear with the concierge in requesting a room that would be secure and that the staff would use discretion in being sensitive to her situation. The concierge mentioned that our room would have a balcony. The concierge did not explain that the balcony is adjacent to an exterior breezeway and elevator lobby which is separated by an easily climbable partition wall about 42 inches tall. Anyone in the breezeway could easily access the door to the patio by climbing over the wall. There were undeniably alternative rooms available featuring isolated balconies that are inaccessible to guests outside the room. So we are puzzled as to why we were assigned to a room with two easily accessible entry points. Over the course of a few hours we noticed a guest in the breezeway who walked by several times while into our room looking through the sliding door on the patio, which was unnerving to put it mildly. This is the reason we requested to be assigned to a different room.


In summary, and without going into further detail, we are looking at the big picture of the hotel failing to accommodate a guest with disabilities, the nature of which was made explicit upon our arrival. From our perspective, they put a guest who struggles with PTSD in more than one situation which excessively exacerbated the symptoms of her condition, and furthermore allowed a guest to harass us over the symptoms of her physical disability (i.e. difficulty walking and allegedly making noise ""like an elephant""). Additionally, as a result of these incidents, we have been unable to take full advantage of the amenities and services we have paid for due to her symptoms being exacerbated and preventing both of us from sleeping.


We have a meeting with a manager this afternoon. Depending on the results, we are considering escalating the matter to the corporate level. Just wanted to get some constructive feedback on this scenario. Do we have any standing to look at taking legal action? And what type of attorney would we contact who might be familiar with relevant circumstances? Thanks in advance for any feedback.

"How is the right to ""speedy trial"" being protected during pandemic?
The right of a person accused of a crime to a ""speedy trial"" is widely considered a fundamental human right. [It is enumerated in a number of government constitutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial).


However during the COVID-19 pandemic many courts suspended operations for months, and now more than 6 months later many are still struggling to resume even limited criminal trials. This means that defendants will wait at least six months longer than usual for trials.

"How is ""civilian infrastructure"" defined in international humanitarian law?
The Houthi forces of Yemen have launched a drone attack on oil facilities and the airport in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates. [UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the strike](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/us-un-condemn-houthi-attack-on-abu-dhabi/2476638), saying:

This appears to be saying that the attacks were against international law because of the nature of the targets.

In response [the coalition has carried out air raids in the Yemeni capital Sanaa](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/18/yemen-more-than-a-dozen-people-killed-in-saudi-coalition-strike), killing more than 12 people and pictures apparently showing [damaged residential buildings](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-18T085101Z_1044977715_RC2G1S9T4LIL_RTRMADP_3_YEMEN-SAUDI-SECURITY.jpg).

This means that no US currency can be destroyed right? Except we did a chemistry lab on campus where we dissolved US pennies from around the 1960’s I believe.

"Why can courts refuse evidence?
#### The question


Layman here. This question was inspired by [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84088/ordered-to-unlocking-a-car-trunk-may-i-lawfully-refuse) and random things I've heard/read over the years.


I'm quite confused by a concept that comes up again and again and which people seem to hold for self-evident. And that concept is that there is some evidence which a court will refuse to admit. And that confuses be because... well, there's evidence. It leads to the truth. Why aren't you taking it?!


It's very easy to come up with realistic examples where:


* There is a piece of evidence which is clearly and irrefutably shows that a person did something very bad (say, murder)
* This evidence is for whatever reason ""not admissible"" (say, it was obtained illegally)
* And there is no other piece of evidence that would incriminate this person.


Does that mean that the perpetrator gets to go free? How can the court refuse to admit evidence, especially if it's the only useful evidence existing? And if yes, then why is this so and where is this practice useful?




---


#### Some examples from the top of my head


The example question above deals with unlawful searches. Imagine that a police officer decided to search a car (or an apartment) and forcefully did so against the protests of the owner (or maybe the owner wasn't even present). They thought they might find drugs or something, but instead they are surprised to discover a dead body, clearly murdered. So... now what? According to the above question, since the search was illegal, this is inadmissible evidence in the court. Does that mean that the owner of the car/apartment gets to go away scott-free? Do they launch a new investigation and try to find other evidence *except* the fact that it was inside the property of this guy here (and failing to do that, release them)? If the owner of the car/apartment says ""I don't know what you're talking about, I last saw Jimmy here alive and well at the pub last night; I never seen his corpse before."" - can they call him out on the obvious lie?


Or, another example. I don't know about USA, but here in Europe it's illegal to record someone's phone calls without a warrant (or something like that; it's serious). Any recordings obtained unlawfully will be inadmissible as evidence.


Let's now imagine that I've gone the full extra mile and have secretly bugged everything in my neighbour's house because I suspect (but have no evidence) that they murdered my child last month. I've got hidden cameras, microphones everywhere, etc. So one day I catch him talking to his spouse on the phone and mentioning the murder, admitting to doing it, and even telling where he buried the body.


Now I have evidence... or do I? I give the recording to the police, they search the indicated place and they do find the body, but since they cannot accept my recording as evidence... does that mean that my neighbour now has no consequences? Let's also suppose that no other evidence is found that would indicate his guilt (the guy was thorough). Obviously I'd get some grief for bugging my neighbour's house, but do I now also become the prime suspect in the murder of my own child? After all - the recording of my neighbour's confession ""officially doesn't exist"", and I'm the one who told the police where to dig, so...",law,0

"Exactly what part of a game can be under copyright or patent?
I have searched the internet and I have understood that copyright will cover the names and graphics of games while patents are for the idea/mechanics of the game.


My questions are:


1. Am I right?
2. If so how can be so many trading card games/collectible card games?
3. What will be considered a ""mechanic""? for example MTG has a specific mana system, if someone will be creating a game with same idea but will refer to it with other names such as ""Ember"" instead of ""Fire"" will it violate the patent?
4. How do I know if certain patents are applied and when they expire? For example MTG is an old game, does the company still have patents on the game mechanics?

"If I use the Deposit Protection Service-provided Alternative Dispute Resolution, is there any danger of legal fees or legal consequences?
The background of the dispute is below. To be clear, this is not really about the money, but about the principle. I believe the landlord is attempting to take advantage, and many tenants more timid than myself would simply knuckle under and pay. I want to make the landlord understand she won't get away with treating people this way.


The DPS provides a dispute resolution service which the landlord is proposing to use, if I do not pay up the £150 she wants to replace the hob. The only circumstances I would pay up, rather than go to the dispute resolution, is if I were exposing myself to some significant risk by choosing the latter. 


IOW: is it plausible that the dispute resolution service would hand me a significantly bigger bill than this landlord is demanding? Is it likely that they could turn around and say 'she only asked for £150, but actually you have to pay her £2000', or something like that? (for reference, the deposit is £1200)


\*\*Edit: A user asked why I would think that a bill of (say) £2000 is a possibility. As it happens, I *don't* think that such a big bill is a possible consequence of going through the DPS resolution process. I am asking because my partner wants to just pay up and be done with it, because she is afraid of unforeseen consequences. I want to be able to reassure my partner that those fears are unfounded.


The point is, it commonplace for the DPS to look at the evidence and decide the landlord deserves more than the landlord asked for?\*\*


**The background**


I have recently moved out of rented accommodation. I am having a dispute with my landlord over the deposit, which is lodged with the DPS (I checked, it is).


The dispute is over a gas hob. The hob is controlled by plastic nobs, one of which I broke while cleaning.


My ex-landlord believes that this means the hob is now unsafe and unusable. She wants to replace the whole hob with a new one, and charge us for it.


I think this is absurd, because:
1) The hob was not new when I moved in two years ago, let alone now. Buying a new hob is not mitigating her losses.


**edit: clarification regarding above -- I'm no lawyer. But it's my understanding that if the hob is indeed broken, I only have to pay what it was worth at the moment before it was broken. If it was only as good as a second hand hob going for e.g. £40, then £40 is what I have to pay. As I said I'm no lawyer, so please advise me if I am mistaken. I also believe, per number 2) below, that the hob can be economically repaired in any case**


2) I do not accept that there is anything wrong with the hob apart from the absence of one plastic knob which could be easily replaced.


The landlord is also contending that one of the taps is 'jammed down' and can't be turned. I don't know what she means by that, except that I was able to turn them. One of them was stiffer than the others, but I do not think that is as a result of me removing and replacing the knobs to clean the hob.


I asked the landlady who says the hob is unsafe, and she said 'the gas inspector'. She gave me his mobile number, but not his name or credentials.


I strongly suspect she is getting advice from people who stand to benefit from fitting a new gas hob instead of repairing it. She says that cooker companies have advised her that no-one fixes gas hobs because it's too dangerous, which again I believe is ridiculous. A google search in my local area reveals a dozen companies who do this.


One other thing: the landlady has known for months that the knob was broken because this 'gas inspector' came round and looked at the hob. If it was indeed damaged by my act and unsafe, he would have known that then, and reported it to the landlady. In that case the landlady would have known that I was living with an unsafe appliance, and would have been breaking the law in a pretty serious way by not addressing that problem... right?",law,0

"Legality of copyright material from Z Library
I've read in multiple places that distributing copyright material that you do not own is illegal. Therefore, uploading to [Z library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Library) is considered illegal.


However, on the point of downloading material without the intent of distributing, I have seen multiple view points. Some people stating that because the user who downloaded it does not re-distribute it there is no illegal activity or at least it is a gray area, as Z library operates under principle of ""information wants to be free"". While others stating it is all completely illegal.


The two scenarios I'm aiming to clear up, in terms of legality, are:


1. An individual downloads from Z library an eBook that he does not own the copyright to and uses it for personal purposes and does not redistribute or sell it.
2. An individual downloads from Z library an eBook that he does not own the copyright to and uses it for commercial purposes within a company, but does not distribute it outside of the company.

"Is the United States federal income tax an indirect tax under the 5th amendment?
I'm no American citizen, so I don't know that much about all the ins and outs of the Constitution. I've been watching a movie where one of the characters called the federal income tax ""unconstitutional"" due to the 5th Amendment. The 5th Amendment reads:



> 
> No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; **nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation**.

"Would judges need to recuse themselves if they own shares of index funds?
I understand that there is some requirement or expectation for judges to recuse themselves from cases where they would have a financial interest in the outcome. [Index funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund) were said to represent ~20% of mutual fund assets in 2014, and I imagine this proportion has only increased since then.

"Saving websites for archiving
I am looking into archiving certain articles of websites (not the whole website or nothing similar) I'm interested in, to keep a personal archive of information I want to have available or that I want to read later offline. As the Save As (Control + S) or the Print (Control + P) options on Chrome give bad results, I was looking into extensions like *WebScrapbook*, or *SingleFile*. The problem is that searching I discovered that scrapping, or crawling a website is in a legal grey area, as it consumes bandwidth and therefore, it costs money to the server owner. The majority of articles about that talk about automated means and downloading large amounts of data from the website, but I DON'T have any intentions of downloading entire websites, with automated robots like *HTTrack*, *SiteSucker* or *wget*, which obviously consume a lot of bandwidth, as you are downloading the entire website content, and sometimes even override the robots.txt rules.

"Is assignment of rental unit occupancy for profit legal and practical in Ontario?

A year ago I started a room renting contract, where landlord asked me to stay there for 1 year maximum and I agreed. This was only accepted by my words and in written email but not signed.

"Misrepresented Land Sale in Arkansas
They realtor selling land in Arkansas listed a 10 acre tract for sale with pictures of the property, and specific information, such as ""at the corner of county road ""blank"" and highway ""blank"" with county and state road access"", and ""mature pine plantation ready for immediate income opportunities"", as the pines were at maturity. We went under contract for the land. It was a cash transaction. The survey took 2 months to complete, as the seller couldn't find anyone to survey the property. Our realtor found a surveyor, although the seller (a timber company) paid for it. We have spent months improving the land with fencing, brush hogging, adding a culvert, etc. The property was flagged, but we thought we received a terrible survey crew. It turned out those flags were the starting points to survey our ""actual"" land. 6 months post sale, a timber company contacts us, and notifies us that we have a gate on their land.


Facts:


1. County Assessor had the parcels flipped on their mapping of the 10 acre property we thought we bought and the 10 acre property North of us (that legally we actually bought)
1.a. The same timber company that notified us that we were on their land were trying to sell
our actually owned land for 3 months, as the parcels were flipped.
2.

The actual land has almost no pine trees, is not ready for immediate income, and the terrain in so awful that there are no places to legitimately build a home on or even get to it.


Do we have any recourse? If so, would it be against the timber company seller or the timber seller's agent? It's our first land purchase. We know better for next time.

"Are street preachers worthy of being sectioned?
Some of them are really ridiculous, like they stand on street corners where they are likely to harass the most people and often they don’t even speak the best (by which I mean the most intelligible) English. They continually shout at passers by who are clearly not interested in their message repetitious slogans devoid of much cogency or insight like “Jesus loves you” or “Jesus died for your sins” over very poor quality amplification systems while jumping up and down and shaking their fists in the air. Often if a given passerby is trying to ignore the preacher as they walk past and not giving any flinch or reaction, they will intensify their harassment and grow louder and more forceful/emphatic in response to individuals’ attempts to ignore them.


Sometimes these are in public parks or squares where people may go to relax or read a book on a bench in the good sunshine but they amplify their harassment to make it impossible to avoid or ignore.


Please note I have nothing wrong with the idea of preaching and proselytising and would clearly distinguish this in terms of its impact on unwilling others from church preachers who genuinely care about their communities and give rigorous thought to how to enrich their members’ lives with the teachings of their faith while bringing the community members closer thereto.


Are the street preachers in clear contrast then given undue privilege in their legal treatment due to the fact that they are propagating a religious cause? Something tells me that if one were out in public jumping up and down clapping and cheering about the Flying Spaghetti Monster or even about a delusion with a less established and thus less coherent (much less founded in reality) significance than the FSM that was specifically devised by a serious intellectual to make a philosophical point, harassing the public as they passed by and not taking others’ queues as to their disinterest but instead shouting more loudly at them in response, they might be sectioned based on the fervour with which they are so spectacularly preaching such delusional idiocy with no foundation in reality.


Or they may be proceeded against for anti social behaviour by causing others’ harassment alarm and distress.


Or public order offences.


Social stunts like Sacha Baton Cohen’s Borat character who would often say to people in public outrageous things like “you Fuck my mother” “i eat your shit” to make them distressed and puzzled is probably well protected in the U.S. due to the first amendment. Likewise, it is easy to see how the 1st amendment’s explicit address of religion gives rise to special privileged treatment of preaching where religious causes are concerned.


But in the UK, free speech is not absolute, and further it seems to me that religious expression is likewise perhaps not under any provision subject to especial/privileged protections.


Is it likely that such obnoxious street preachers disturbing the public peace are subject to privileged treatment due to the general perception among the system’s various functionaries that their activity is a long and well established phenomenon/practice, so therefore it should be allowed however much it affects others because it must be protected since it is such a historically established activity?

Some drugs can stay in a person’s system for a week or more, so if someone had a fun Saturday night and a random drug test happens on Tuesday, they could lose their livelihood. Is this at all considered in company policies or drug laws?",law,0

"Landlord Ignoring My Potential Replacements (UK)
In October last year (2019), I (22, M) moved into a houseshare in Bristol to attend my final year of university. I signed the contract knowing that I would be moving out after exams finished in May/June, which the landlord said was fine provided I found a suitable replacement. This was proved in December when one of my housemates moved out and there was a new tenant in 2 days later.


Forward to March, coronavirus shuts down the university and everything moves online, so I decide to move back home to be with my family and hopefully save some money on rent. On the 22nd March, I posted an advert on Facebook marketplace and my landlord assured he would do the same (he did not). I was immediately inundated with messages from eager prospective tenants wanting to move in ASAP. As the landlord instructed, I passed on his email address to suitable prospective tenants.


A few days passed, and I had not heard anything, so I messaged my landlord for an update and he responded that due to new social distancing rules he would not be able to do any viewings, so finding a new tenant would be unlikely. I informed the landlord that the other housemates all said that they were happy to host viewings themselves either in person or via video, which he ignored. Repeated follow up messages regarding this and asking about the possibility of subletting for a month or two were similarly ignored. Eventually I called him to discuss the situation, and he told me that he would not allow subletting under any circumstances (did not provide a reason) and to find someone who could show proof of income and three months rent upfront, and he would do his best to move them in as soon as possible.


I found four people who had proof of income and were happy to pay the three months upfront, all wanting to move in ASAP. After informing the landlord of this, I was again repeatedly ignored and heard nothing back until 1st April when rent was due, which, reluctantly, I paid. The landlord then told me that again due to coronavirus, the earliest somebody would be able to move in would be the 1st May.


I continued to pass on his contact details to those who seemed suitable, letting the landlord know the names to look out for in his emails. I had passed on the details to over 20 suitable candidates, but heard nothing back from the landlord. Eager to not have to waste rent for a second month, I sent messages asking for an update on the 21st, 24th, 27th, and 30th April. I did not receive a reply until the 30th, when the landlord informed me that he would now be unable to move anyone in until the 1st June, but that he did not see a problem with moving someone in then.


May passed by, and I continued to direct people to the landlord, and continued to be ignored when I informed him or asked for updates. Around the 24th May, I decided to message back one of the prospective tenants asking if they had had a viewing/heard back from the landlord. To my surprise, they told me that they had sent an email but received no reply, so had assumed the room had been taken. I contacted the landlord about this and (surprise surprise) he did not reply. I decided to ask a few more prospective tenants about this, and all of them had messaged him and either been declined a viewing or got no reply at all. When I confronted the landlord about this, he simply said that he gets a lot of emails and he's too busy to go through them all, and to pass on his mobile number instead.


By this point, it was now 1st June and there was still nobody to take the room. The landlord spoke to me and said that rent was still due, however I would be reimbursed when someone else moved in, which the landlord assured me would be within a week as he had several viewings booked. I was hesitant, but knowing that I had sent many more people to him, I once again paid.


Passing on his number managed to get a few people booked into viewings, however nowhere near as many as people I spoke to. I decided to chase up the prospective tenants again to see if the landlord had responded. It may not come as a surprise that the responses I got back consisted mainly of:


'he read my message but never responded'


'I spoke to him on the phone and he said he'd call be back but never did'


'I've called him a few times but he hasn't picked up""


What was surprising, however, are the messages from people who said they had spoken to him, but had been refused a viewing. I again confronted him on this to which he responded 'No one has been refused viewings'. I sent him the screenshot of the conversation with the prospective tenant, which he again ignored.


Now comes perhaps the most infuriating part. A girl who had viewed the house messaged me saying that she would like to take the room. I told her that I was happy for her to take it, and that she should contact the landlord to arrange contracts and details. I also contacted the landlord letting her know that I was happy for her to take it. He did not respond. I told her to try him again the next day. Once again, no response. We have both been messaging him and calling all week, and neither of us have received any reply or acknowledgement.


The girl has now contacted me again voicing her concerns about moving into a place with such an unreliable landlord, and I am now unsure what to do if the room does not get taken.


My question is, do I have any legal standing that I could use to stop paying rent/take the landlord to court? I have been paying rent on a place that I have not been living in for three months, essentially wasting ~£1500, which as an unemployed student is really not an affordable loss. Has the landlord breached any contractual agreements that could potentially be used against him to possibly recover any of the money? For info, it is a joint tenancy for the whole house and I am the lead tenant.",law,0
"Is it Illegal to sue a company that sells fake products to US customers?

"Is it illegal to hire by age in the US?
Maybe one of the fields that has the most ""ageism"" is programming and software engineering jobs.


There were multiple times I hear of the CEO or SVP at the final approval stage: ""we want to hire a more junior person"", and rejected the candidate and the 10 hours of interviews by 6 tech people and 3 manager level people.


Some say, before age 35, a person is most creative and productive, and it is all about productivity.


In reality, when you are 25 or 28, you are more likely to stay up working till 3am, sleep, and wake up at 9am and continue to work. However, most companies claim they want 40 hours per week and work life balance, so they won't burn somebody out in 1.5 years and then have to dump them.


Also, programming and software engineering isn't like painter or poet or novelist. They don't need that much creativity. They are more like engineers building roads or bridges, where experience is important too.


One other reason I can think of is, if the manager is 32, he wouldn't want to hire somebody 38 or 45, because then that person appears more like a manager than he or she is. (and that a 28 year old is more like to listen to the 32, and a 45 year old is probably less likely).


And just because they want to hire somebody 35 or under, isn't it ageism and therefore, discrimination by age, and therefore illegal in the US?


I even talked to a lawyer that says, ""if we sue, that means these cases are flying all over the sky"" (and therefore it is like people quietly accept them).


It also appears that the CEO or SVP are bold enough to even at the final offer approval stage, say ""rejected. We want a more junior person.""",law,0
"LGPL open source project - condition on invoking license (no right to use the software) on certain modifications. Is it possible?
Released a software under LGPL license.


Now added also a paid license check to it, so users can also upgrade to commercial license.


However, I think some users can remove the check and re-release it under LGPL


Can I somehow prohibit it? If license check code parts are modified, users rights, license (LGPL) are completely removed and there is not right to use this modified software.


How can I protect against this modification of code?


With close source it can be cracked, but with Open Source it would be very easy to remove it and release in the Internet as a new project.


What are your suggestions?


Was thinking to add a extra clause in ""commons clause"" in LGPL that would say:
